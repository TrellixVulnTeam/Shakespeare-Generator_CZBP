# Shakespeare-Generator
This little project generates Shakespeare plays by training its underlying n-gram word model with Shakespeare's entire corpus. Feel free to adjust what n is within the .ipynb file; just be warned that using n's over 11 will require some patience!

Note: for some reason, running the shakespeare_working.ipynb file yields no problems, but the exact same code ported over to shakespeare.py is having trouble. I'll be looking into possible fixes; for now, avoid shakespeare.py.
