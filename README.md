# Shakespeare-Generator
This little project generates Shakespeare plays by training its underlying n-gram word model with Shakespeare's entire corpus. When you run `shakespeare.py`, you will be prompted to specify a value for n (just be warned that using n's over 11 will require some patience!) and the number of words you want to generate (set at 100 by default).
