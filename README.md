# Shakespeare-Generator
This little project generates Shakespeare plays by training its underlying n-gram word model with Shakespeare's entire corpus. Feel free to adjust what n is at the bottom of the `shakespeare.py` file; just be warned that using n's over 11 will require some patience!

Additionally, you can tell the algorithm how many words you want generated (default is 100).
